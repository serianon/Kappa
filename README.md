This android-app is going to be a SCRUM planning-poker-app that tries to not be ugly for once or ported from iOS. 

Well, someday hopefully. Right now, it's a playground app for trying out some new things. Caution: Hackathon-style code.

# TODO:

- more numbers + selection via settings
- support at least a second theme/color-scheme
- try out android architecture components?
- MaterialDesign2 when available
- fix the issues #1 and #2
- a name
