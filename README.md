This android-app is going to be a SCRUM planning-poker-app that tries to not be ugly for once or iOS-ported. 

Well, someday hopefully. Right now, it's a playground app for trying out some new things. Caution: Still hackathon-style code.

# TODO:
- version number count (using commit-count)
- release-build(s)
- port to Kotlin
- smooth transitions between card-view and overview
- fix auto-font-size in overview
- card with ripple-effect
- ...
- more numbers + selection via settings
- android architecture components?
- try out some interesting architectures, like single-activity
- a name
