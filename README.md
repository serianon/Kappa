This android-app is going to be a SCRUM planning-poker-app that tries to not be ugly for once or ported from iOS. 

Well, someday hopefully. Right now, it's a playground app for trying out some new things. Caution: Hackathon-style code.

# TODO:
- port to Kotlin
- more numbers + selection via settings
- support at least a second theme/color-scheme
- android architecture components?
- try out some interesting architectures, like single-activity
- MaterialDesign2 when available
- fix the issues #1 and #2
- a name
- ...
